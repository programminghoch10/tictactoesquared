## How to play

The first player placed his marker anywhere. 
The next player needs to place his marker in the field, 
which is in the position of the marker of the previous player accordingly. 

I know this is kinda hard to understand, 
but the game shows you where you are allowed to place, 
by surrounding the field, in which you may place your marker.

You win the game, by winning small TTTs, which form the big one.

So if you won the upper left field and the lower right field, 
you will win the game, if you win the middle field, 
which would result in you having three in a row in the big field.

## AI

You will be playing against an AI at the moment.

Beating the AI is though, but it is possible to do so.

## Android app

There is an Android app available!
